        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F (if intending to bake them).</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a medium size cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 minutes until onion is translucent.</li>
            <li>Add capsicum, cook for 1 minute. Add diced tomato, cook for 2 minutes until broken down and it becomes a bit pasty (see video).</li>
            <li>Add canned tomatoes, tomato paste, broth, paprika, cumin, salt and pepper. Mix to combine well.</li>
            <li>Lower stove to medium low and simmer for 5 minutes until just thickened enough to make indentations (don't want dry sludge, needs to still be saucy).</li>
            <li>Make indentations in the mixture and carefully crack the eggs in. Leave to cook for 1 minute until edges of whites are set (Note 1).
            </li>
            <li>Transfer to oven and bake for 7 to 12 minutes until whites are just set but yolks are still runny (or to your taste). OR cover with lid and steam on stove for 3 minutes (runny yolks), or just simmer them without a lid.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven/stove and serve immediately, scattered with the coriander or parsley. Serve with crusty bread, or pita bread.
            </li>
